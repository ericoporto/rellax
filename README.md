_This module uses the Camera and Viewport API from **Adventure Game Studio 3.5.0**._

### Usage

Before starting, you must create the following Custom Properties
in AGS Editor, for usage with Objects.
Just click on **`Properties [...]`** and on the **`Edit Custom Properties`** screen,
click on **`Edit Schema ...`** button, and add the two properties below:

- PxPos:
  - **`Name`:** `PxPos`
  - **`Description`:** `Object's horizontal parallax`
  - **`Type`:** `Number`
  - **`Default Value`:** `0`


- PyPos:
  - **`Name`:** `PyPos`
  - **`Description`:** `Object's vertical parallax`
  - **`Type`:** `Number`
  - **`Default Value`:** `0`

The number defined on `Px` or `Py` will be divided by 100 and used to increase
the scrolling. An object with `Px` and `Py` 0 is scrolled normally, an object
with `Px` and `Py` 100 will be fixed on the screen despite camera movement.

### Scritp API
